The useReducer hook in React is an alternative to useState for managing complex state logic. It’s particularly useful when you have multiple states that rely on each other or complex state transitions.

Syntax of useReducer:
```js
const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);
```

- state: The current state.
- dispatch: A function used to trigger state changes.
- reducer: A function that defines how the state is updated based on an action.
- initialState: The starting value of the state.

## Simple Example:

Let’s create a simple counter using useReducer.

- Step 1: Define the reducer function

The reducer takes the current state and an action. It returns a new state based on the action.

```js
const reducer = (state, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'increment':
      return { count: state.count + 1 };
    case 'decrement':
      return { count: state.count - 1 };
    case 'reset':
      return { count: 0 };
    default:
      return state;
  }
};
```

- Step 2: Use the useReducer hook in your component

```js
import React, { useReducer } from 'react';

const Counter = () => {
  const initialState = { count: 0 };

  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {state.count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'increment' })}>Increment</button>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'decrement' })}>Decrement</button>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'reset' })}>Reset</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Counter;
```

## Explanation:
- reducer function: It takes the current state (state) and the action (action.type). Based on the action type, it returns a new state.
- Initial state: { count: 0 } is the initial state passed to useReducer.
- dispatch function: It’s used to trigger state changes. For example, calling dispatch({ type: 'increment' }) increases the count.

## Pros of useReducer:
- Better for handling complex state logic.
- Makes it easier to manage multiple state transitions compared to useState.

## Cons:
- Might be overkill for simple state management where useState suffices.
- This example shows a basic use case of useReducer to handle a counter.
